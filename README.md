Package overview
----------------

* `mobipick_bringup`: Launch and configuration files for the real Mobipick robot
* `mobipick_description`: URDF description of the robot
* `mobipick_gazebo`: Simulation specific launch and configuration files
* `mobipick_moveit_config`: MoveIt! launch and configuration files
* `mobipick_pick_n_place`: Some demo nodes that show off the MoveIt capabilities of the robot


Installation
------------

First, [install ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation). Then:

```bash
# create a catkin workspace and clone all required ROS packages
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone -b noetic <URL of this repo>

mobipick/install-deps.sh
mobipick/build.sh
```

If you have a physical pico flexx camera attached to this PC, also follow the
installation instructions of the
[pico_flexx_driver](https://github.com/code-iai/pico_flexx_driver). These
cannot be integrated into the instructions above because they require a manual
download step.

You can also optionally install the dependencies in
dependencies-optional.rosinstall; simply uncomment the relevant line in
`install-deps.sh` before running it.

You should add the following line to the end of your `~/.bashrc`, and then
close and reopen all terminals:

```bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

**Note:** Since we are using the `devel` space, some nodes (for example in
Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver) still have the `#!/usr/bin/env python` shebang
line. If this leads to an error, simply install the package
`python-is-python3`.


Quick start
-----------

The following examples describe how to use the robot in simulation. For more
information on how to use the real mobipick robot have a look at the
[README.md in `mobipick_bringup`](mobipick_bringup/README.md).

### Pick + Place with move_base demo (BerghoffstraÃŸe)

![Video: Mobipick pick + place demo (Gazebo)](doc/img/mobipick_gazebo_moelk_5x.mp4)

```bash
roslaunch mobipick_gazebo mobipick_moelk.launch
rosservice call /gazebo/unpause_physics
roslaunch mir_gazebo fake_localization.launch __ns:="mobipick" odom_frame_id:="mobipick/odom" base_frame_id:="mobipick/base_footprint"
roslaunch mir_navigation start_planner.launch map_file:=$(rospack find pbr_maps)/maps/moelk/pbr_robot_lab.yaml virtual_walls_map_file:=$(rospack find pbr_maps)/maps/moelk/pbr_robot_lab_virtual_walls.yaml  prefix:="mobipick/"
roslaunch mobipick_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch
rviz -d $(rospack find mir_navigation)/rviz/navigation.rviz __ns:="mobipick"
roslaunch mobipick_pick_n_place mobipick_pick_n_place.launch simulation:=true
rosservice call /mobipick/continue_statemachine
```

There exists also an analogous demo using [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP)
instead of a state machine. The implementation doesn't support pausing as easily, however,
so this functionality is removed.
The graphical editor [Groot](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot) is integrated in this demo.
To see its visualization, run `rosrun groot Groot` and connect the monitor with default settings
after the behavior tree started.

```bash
roslaunch mobipick_gazebo mobipick_moelk.launch
rosservice call /gazebo/unpause_physics
roslaunch mir_gazebo fake_localization.launch __ns:="mobipick" odom_frame_id:="mobipick/odom" base_frame_id:="mobipick/base_footprint"
roslaunch mir_navigation start_planner.launch map_file:=$(rospack find pbr_maps)/maps/moelk/pbr_robot_lab.yaml virtual_walls_map_file:=$(rospack find pbr_maps)/maps/moelk/pbr_robot_lab_virtual_walls.yaml  prefix:="mobipick/"
roslaunch mobipick_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch
rviz -d $(rospack find mir_navigation)/rviz/navigation.rviz __ns:="mobipick"
roslaunch mobipick_pick_n_place moveit_macros.launch
roslaunch mobipick_pick_n_place mobipick_pick_n_place_bt.launch simulation:=true
rosrun groot Groot  # and connect the monitor with default settings
```

For both state machine and behavior tree version, optionally execute
`rosservice call /mobipick/simulate_user_interaction` during the user interaction step to fake taking the power drill.

### Pick + Place demo (MoveIt! demo mode)

![Video: Mobipick pick + place demo (Gazebo)](doc/img/mobipick_moveit_demo_mode_5x.mp4)

```bash
roslaunch mobipick_moveit_config demo.launch
roslaunch mobipick_pick_n_place mobipick_pick_n_place.launch simulation:=true object_source:=static
rosservice call /mobipick/continue_statemachine
```

* Make sure that the parameter `use_sim_time` is set to `false`.
* You can play around with different planning pipelines, which you can select
  in the the "MotionPlanning" pane in RViz under "Context".
  - `chomp` (with our current configuration) is very slow (takes 50 s on my
    machine). `chomp` is the default *in RViz* (because RViz uses alphabetical
    sorting).
  - `ompl` is much faster and is used in the `pick_n_place` demos. `ompl` is
    the default *in MoveIt*.
  - `pilz_industrial_motion_planner` is a simplistic motion planning pipeline
    that works for easy motions. It is somewhat hard to control from RViz, but
    the `PTP` planner works.


### move_base demo (maze world)

```bash
roslaunch mobipick_gazebo mobipick_maze_world.launch
rosservice call /gazebo/unpause_physics   # or click the "start" button in the Gazebo GUI
roslaunch mir_gazebo fake_localization.launch __ns:="mobipick" odom_frame_id:="mobipick/odom" base_frame_id:="mobipick/base_footprint" delta_x:=-10.0 delta_y:=-10.0
ROS_NAMESPACE=mobipick rosrun mobipick_gazebo move_arm_to_home
roslaunch mir_navigation start_planner.launch \
    map_file:=$(rospack find mir_gazebo)/maps/maze.yaml prefix:="mobipick/" \
    virtual_walls_map_file:=$(rospack find mir_gazebo)/maps/maze_virtual_walls.yaml
rviz -d $(rospack find mir_navigation)/rviz/navigation.rviz __ns:="mobipick"
```

Now, you can use the "2D Nav Goal" tool in RViz to set a navigation goal for move_base.


### move_base demo (MRK lab world)

```bash
roslaunch mobipick_gazebo mobipick_mrk_lab_world.launch
rosservice call /gazebo/unpause_physics   # or click the "start" button in the Gazebo GUI
roslaunch mir_gazebo fake_localization.launch __ns:="mobipick" odom_frame_id:="mobipick/odom" base_frame_id:="mobipick/base_footprint"
ROS_NAMESPACE=mobipick rosrun mobipick_gazebo move_arm_to_home
roslaunch mir_navigation start_planner.launch \
    map_file:=$(rospack find mobipick_gazebo)/maps/rh5_mrk_lab.yaml prefix:="mobipick/"
rviz -d $(rospack find mir_navigation)/rviz/navigation.rviz __ns:="mobipick"
```

Now, you can use the "2D Nav Goal" tool in RViz to set a navigation goal for move_base.


### Pick + Place with demo (Smart Factory)

```bash
roslaunch mobipick_gazebo mobipick_smart_factory.launch
rosservice call /gazebo/unpause_physics
roslaunch mir_gazebo fake_localization.launch __ns:="mobipick" odom_frame_id:="mobipick/odom" base_frame_id:="mobipick/base_footprint" delta_yaw:=1.57 delta_x:=-11.77 delta_y:=-19.74
roslaunch mir_navigation start_planner.launch map_file:=$(rospack find mobipick_gazebo)/maps/smart_factory.yaml prefix:="mobipick/" with_virtual_walls:=true virtual_walls_map_file:=$(rospack find mobipick_gazebo)/maps/smart_factory_objects.yaml
roslaunch mobipick_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch
rviz -d $(rospack find mir_navigation)/rviz/navigation.rviz __ns:="mobipick" world:="smart_factory"
roslaunch mobipick_pick_n_place mobipick_pick_n_place.launch simulation:=true world:="smart_factory"
rosservice call /mobipick/continue_statemachine
```

### Rosbridge with websockets

```bash
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch port:=9090
```

### Using the arm velocity controller or position controller

If you want to use the velocity/position controller for the arm, add
`arm_controller:=velocity/position` to any of the launch files, like so:


```bash
roslaunch mobipick_gazebo mobipick_table_world.launch arm_controller:=velocity # or arm_controller:=position
rosservice call /gazebo/unpause_physics   # or click the "start" button in the Gazebo GUI
```

Now you can send velocity commands to the arm directly, like this:

```bash
rostopic pub /arm_velocity_controller/command std_msgs/Float64MultiArray "data: [0.4, 0.1, -0.1, 0, 0, 0]"
```

In this configuration, MoveIt won't work however, since MoveIt requires the
joint trajectory controller instead of the velocity controller (because MoveIt
is a joint trajectory client).

You can switch to the arm trajectory controller like this:

```bash
rosrun controller_manager controller_manager stop arm_velocity_controller
rosrun controller_manager controller_manager start arm_controller
```

This also works the other way around, e.g. if you didn't add the
`arm_controller:=velocity` argument to the launch file:

```bash
rosrun controller_manager controller_manager stop arm_controller
rosrun controller_manager controller_manager start arm_velocity_controller
```

If you prefer a graphical interface, try this:

```bash
rosrun rqt_controller_manager rqt_controller_manager
```

Updating the SRDF
-----------------

Whenever the URDF of the robot changes, the SRDF has to be updated as well.
Since we changed the URDF to xacro, the following process is necessary:

```bash
roscd mobipick_moveit_config/config/
xacro mobipick.srdf.xacro tf_prefix:=mobipick > mobipick.srdf
roslaunch mobipick_moveit_config setup_assistant.launch

sed -i 's/mobipick\//${tf_prefix}/g' mobipick.srdf
meld mobipick.srdf mobipick.srdf.xacro   # compare and apply all relevant changes
rm mobipick.srdf
```


pre-commit Formatting Checks
----------------------------

This repo has a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) check that runs in CI.
You can use this locally and set it up to run automatically before you commit
something. To install, use pip:

```bash
pip3 install --user pre-commit
```

To run over all the files in the repo manually:

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```

To run pre-commit automatically before committing in the local repo, install the git hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```


Known Issues
------------

### Using MoveIt to plan for the "gripper" group does not work

In Gazebo, trying to use MoveIt to plan a gripper movement to the "open" state
closes the gripper and vice versa. This is caused by the following sequence of
events:

* MoveIt plans a joint trajectory for the gripper (e.g., it plans to the group
  state **"closed"** with a `gripper_finger_joint` angle of 0.755 radians).
* It then sends this trajectory to the controller.
* However, in the `simple_moveit_controllers.yaml` file, we only specify a
  controller of type [`GripperCommand`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/control_msgs/html/action/GripperCommand.html).
  In that action, the `position` fields encodes the gripper gap size (in
  meters). MoveIt incorrectly fills in 0.755 regardless.
* The controller interprets this as 0.755 meters instead of radians (which is
  the correct interpretation of the action definition) and **opens** the
  gripper to the maximum gap size, even though we planned to the **closed**
  state. The inverse case happens when planning to the open state.

One solution to this problem would be to replace the gripper controller with a
[`FollowJointTrajectory`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/control_msgs/html/action/FollowJointTrajectory.html)
controller in the `simple_moveit_controllers.yaml` file, like this:

```yaml
  - name: "gripper_controller"
    action_ns: "follow_joint_trajectory"
    type: FollowJointTrajectory
    default: false
    joints:
      - $(arg prefix)gripper_finger_joint
```

However, this would mean that the Gazebo simulation no longer mirrors the real
robot (which does not have a `FollowJointTrajectory` controller), and also the
pick and place demo would stop working in Gazebo. Therefore, we leave the controller
configuration unchanged. Users should not use MoveIt to plan and execute
gripper trajectories, but instead call the `/mobipick/gripper_hw` action (type:
`GripperCommand`) directly.


Troubleshooting
---------------

### Problem: Arm doesn't move

Sometimes the arm doesn't move, and the following errors appear in the log:

```text
[ WARN] [1625228178.110222489]: Controller arm_controller failed with error INVALID_GOAL:  (/mobipick/move_group)
[ WARN] [1625228178.110321441]: Controller handle arm_controller reports status FAILED (/mobipick/move_group)
[ INFO] [1625228178.110378244]: Completed trajectory execution with status FAILED ... (/mobipick/move_group)
```

This happens every time that `roslaunch mobipick_bringup
mobipick_bringup_control.launch` is restarted, because the program on the UR5
robot must be started **after** that launch file is run.

**Solution:** First make sure that `mobipick_bringup_control.launch` is
running, then stop and restart the UR program on the robot. You can do this by
pressing "stop" and then "start on the teaching pendant. Alternatively, call
the following services:

```bash
rosservice call /mobipick/ur_hardware_interface/dashboard/stop
rosservice call /mobipick/ur_hardware_interface/dashboard/play
```
