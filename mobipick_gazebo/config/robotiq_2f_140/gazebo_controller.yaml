# Note: You MUST load these PID parameters for all joints that are using the
# PositionJointInterface, otherwise the arm + gripper will act like a giant
# parachute, counteracting gravity, and causing some of the wheels to lose
# contact with the ground, so the robot won't be able to properly navigate. See
