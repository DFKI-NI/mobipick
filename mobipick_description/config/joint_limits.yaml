    # Reachable joint angles are limited by the Mobipick robot structure to
    # roughly [-222.4, ..., 42.4] for the shoulder_lift_joint. It's important
    # to restrict the joint angles to less than the full 720 degrees, otherwise
    # the planning space is discontinuous (also see comment for elbow_joint).
    #
    # Reasons for position limits:
    # * shoulder_lift.min_position=-pi and elbow_joint.min_position=0:
    #   The combination of these two limits ensures that there are no IK solutions
    #   which require full arm reconfigurations during picking from table height.
    #   These IK solutions would lead to undesirable "overhead" trajectories and also
    #   mess up the path simplification (planner produces a feasible plan, but path
    #   "simplification" introduces jumps from one configuration to the opposite one).
    # * shoulder_lift.max_position=0.74: all values > 0.74 are in self collision
    #   (this limit is just an optimization)
    max_position: !degrees   42.4 # = 0.74, default:  360.0
    max_velocity: !degrees  180.0

    # we artificially limit this joint to half its actual joint position limit
    # to avoid (MoveIt/OMPL) planning problems, as due to the physical
    # construction of the robot, it's impossible to rotate the 'elbow_joint'
    # over more than approx +- 1 pi (the shoulder lift joint gets in the way).
    #
    # This leads to planning problems as the search space will be divided into
    # two sections, with no connections from one to the other.

    # Reasons for additional position limits:

    # Reasons for position limits:
    # * wrist_3 limits: It's nice to center the range around (pi - 0.25),
    #   because that is where our "home" position is and where the cables are
    #   least stretched. From there, wrist_3 can move pi in either direction.
